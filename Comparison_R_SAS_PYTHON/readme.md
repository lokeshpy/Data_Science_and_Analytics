In this article I’m going to present a comparison on three (R-Studio, SAS Studio, Python Edu IDEs) different for Data Analysis. Each of the tools will be compared with the standards of Background, Jobs, Cost, Learning, Data Handling, Visualization, Statistical Capabilities, Data Task, Deep Learning, Support and Future outlook.	
###Historical Background:
SAS (previously "Statistical Analysis System") is a statistical software suite developed by SAS Institute for data management, advanced analytics, multivariate analysis, business intelligence, criminal investigation and predictive analytics. It was developed at North Carolina State University from 1966 until 1976, when SAS Institute was incorporated. SAS was further developed in the 1980s and 1990s with the addition of new statistical procedures, additional components and the introduction of JMP. A point-and-click interface was added in version 9 in 2004. A social media analytics product was added in 2010.

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls, data mining surveys, and studies of scholarly literature databases show substantial increases in popularity; as of January 2020, R ranks 18th in the TIOBE index, a measure of popularity of programming languages.

Python is an interpreter, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

###Job Perspective:

R and Python are open source, which mean free. These open source software are mostly used by startup or companies looking for cost effective. A survey for each year for the past six years, Burtch Works asked Data Analytics and Data Scientists professionals which programming language R, SAS, & Python they prefer and examined the responses to see how tool preferences vary by a variety of factors. As you can see from the six year trend, Python has more than doubled its share of the vote since its introduction in 2016 – from 20% to 41%. R squeaked by SAS to narrowly claim second place with 30% of the vote over SAS’ 29%.

###Availability / Cost:

As we already aware that R and Python are open source that means it’s a free software that can be downloaded without purchasing any license. However, if we run into any issue with this programs the only support we can get is from public forums and from online searches. This application doesn’t have any sort of customer service support. On other hand, SAS is a commercial software so we need to purchase license for this application and its very expensive one. Big organization use this software and option like Customer Service and Tech support are available with the licensed version.

###Ease of usage/learning:

R programming language is a low level language and hence simple procedure can take longer codes which required one to learn and understand the coding. It also have vertical learning curve among other language. 

Python is very easy to learn and understand due to its simplicity and versatility. If you are new to programming and coding Python is good place to start for beginners. 

SAS is one of the easiest language as well. Anyone can learn this programming language no prior experience are needed and also if you have SQL experience, it’s easy to understand SAS and one more advantage is we have nice GUI page as well.

###Data handling capabilities:

R utilize all the RAM while running the program. It a disadvantage for R as it depended on hardware, but this is no longer the case. These three languages have good data handling capabilities and options for parallel computations. They’ve all also brought on Hadoop and Spark integrations, with them also supporting Cloudera and Apache Pig. For data management and handling factor, we can conclude that all three of Python, SAS, and R fare equally well as all provide a parallel way of computations.


###Visualization capabilities:

SAS provides visualization functionalities. But it is entirely functional. To do any customization over it is a difficult task to achieve. To customize, we need to understand the SAS Graph package thoroughly.

R has the best visualization capabilities because of the packages like Lattice, ggplot, RGIS, etc. The graphical presentation is very much important when we are talking about data science. R produces a dynamic and interactive graphic interface.

In the case of visualization capabilities, Python gives a tough competition to R with the help of graphical packages such as VisPy, Matplotlib. But it is still complex when compared to R.

###Statistical capabilities:

R is a popular, open-source statistics environment that can be extended by packages almost at will. New statistical methods are quickly implemented. R is a particularly good choice for frequent users that plan to deal more extensively with statistics and don’t want to be restricted by their statistical program.

Python is particularly well-suited to the Deep Learning and Machine Learning fields, and is also practical as statistics software through the use of packages, which can easily be installed. But not all statistical methods are available. Some development environments for statistics are still in their infancy. In recent years it has also developed into a serious statistics program due to a large number of high-performance packages, and is increasing in popularity.

SAS Institute offers a professional statistics software that is commonly used in biometrics, clinical research, and in the banking sector. Fast integration of new statistical methods, very stable and reliable routines. The software consists of different modules, some of which follow completely different operating concepts, and the training for SAS is correspondingly complex. Compared to other commercial competitors, SAS is one of the most expensive solutions (which is partially driven by its focus on larger companies and organizations).

###Data task scenarios:

SAS one or more data sources to be evaluated for the behaviors of interest. One or more scenarios in which parameters, properties, rules, and other items are defined. Optionally, one or more scorecards, by actionable entity.

Much of the power of R comes from the thousands of “packages” written by its community of open source contributors. These are optimized for specific statistical, graphical or data-processing tasks. To see what packages are available in the basic distribution of R

Python as Data reading, parsing, munging, wrangling, and numerical Pandas, numpy, scipy


###Deep Learning Support:

Python has progressed drastically in the field of deep learning by introducing TensorFlow and Keras.

R has introduced KerasR and Keras packages. These are behaving as an interface for Python Keras packages.

SAS has recently introduced deep learning and it is still in the development phase. There is a long road to travel for SAS for deep learning.

###Customer service support and Community:

As Python and R being open-source languages, there is no technical support provided for any issues. Although, there are various big online communities from there you can get great help for any issues. 

SAS provides an awesome technical support experience that is not available for Python and R. It also has a great community.

###Future Outlook of Tool:

Due to the open nature of R and Python, the development of new features and techniques are fast as compared to SAS. Although there are chances of issues in development as they are not well-tested due to its open contribution.

SAS introduces a new version in the form of software releases or rollouts. As it is a licensed one, all the features and updates are well tested. It is less prone to errors as compared to Python and R.

Python is used widely in web development. So if you are in an online business, using Python for web development and analytics can provide synergies

SAS used to have a big advantage of deploying end to end infrastructure (Visual Analytics, Data warehouse, Data quality, reporting and analytics), which has been mitigated by integration / support of R on platforms like SAP HANA and Tableau. It is still, far away from seamless integration like SAS, but the journey has started.
